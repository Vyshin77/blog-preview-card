## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this blog preview card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Responsive Mobile display
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project helped me with learning css flexbox and also how to use the CSS pseudo selectors for an actual project

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:
``` css
  h2:hover {
  cursor: pointer;
  color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
```

### Continued development

I will like to use other CSS pseudo selectors in other projects that I'll undertake.
